## [InOut.cpp]()  

**Problem Statement**:  

The input consists of one line with a number of test cases T, and then T more lines,
each of which contains two positive integers N and M. The desired output form is Case #x: y z,
where x, y, and z are all integers; x is the case number (starting from 1),
y is the sum of N and M, and z is the product of N and M.

## [GBus.cpp]()

**Problem Statement**:  

There exists a straight line along which cities are built.

Each city is given a number starting from 1. So if there are 10 cities, city 1 has a number 1, city 2 has a number 2,... city 10 has a number 10.

Different buses (named GBus) operate within different cities, covering all the cities along the way. The cities covered by a GBus are represented as 'first_city_number last_city_number' So, if a GBus covers cities 1 to 10 inclusive, the cities covered by it are represented as '1 10'

We are given the cities covered by all the GBuses. We need to find out how many GBuses go through a particular city.
