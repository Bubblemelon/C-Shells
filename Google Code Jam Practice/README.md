**Problem Statement**:  

The input consists of one line with a number of test cases T, and then T more lines,
each of which contains two positive integers N and M. The desired output form is Case #x: y z,
where x, y, and z are all integers; x is the case number (starting from 1),
y is the sum of N and M, and z is the product of N and M.
