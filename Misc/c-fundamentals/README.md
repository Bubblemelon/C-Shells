## [loan.c](#loanc)

A program that calculates the remaining balance of a loan after the 1st to the 5th monthly payments.

Notes on `float`:
- Often used as an approximation of a number.
- Append "f" for float constants e.g. `const float var = 12.3f;`
- Use `%.nf` to specify `n` digits after the decimal point, e.g. `%.3f` is three digits after the decimal point.
